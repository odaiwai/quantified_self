# Vision Problems

Around about the time I got my new Glasses in December 2014, I noticed that I was having difficulty focussing clearly.  I put this issue down to have a slight astigmatism, and glasses which appeared to have a slightly off prescription.

I noticed that I could never get these glasses to appear clean enough, and I had issues with blurring, especially in my left eye. It was like I had a frosted contact lens wandering around my eyeball!

In the last month, I was on assignment in Jakarta, and noticed that I had a vey large Eye Floater in my left eye, and the blurring effect was noticeably distracting.

Today (2016/04/20) I went to an Eye specialist, and she examined my retinas in detail. (The process involved putting a contact lens on, and that caused me to have almost of full on panic attack: I can't tolerate people touching my eyeballs since an ill-fated experiment with contact lenses in the early 1990's.  If you're a fat British woman of Indian extraction, and you worked for Boots in Epsom in 1991/2, you are a monster for not explaining the concept of saline solutions for contact lenses to me.)
